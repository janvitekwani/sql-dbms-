a database management system is the collection of interelated data and a set of program to access those data 
  primary goal of dbms - to provide and retrieve database information that is convient and efficient to use
  1) larger bodies of information 
  2) define , manipluate and managing the safelty

  why do we need the dbms ?
  before the dbms we typically use the file system is supported by a conventional operating system 
  disadvantage of using the file system 
  1) data redundancy and inconsistency -  means same data will get written again and again and delete any input will create an inconsistency in data
  2) difficulty in accessing the data
  3) data isolation 
  4) integrity problem  - the data values stored in the database must satisfy certain types of consistency constraints
  4) atomicity problem - like one complete action should be performed means a complete transaction should be record as complete
  5) concurrent access anomalies - means multiple users using the same application at once'
  6) security problem - if we need the certain part of the data to be access than it will lead to security problem 

  so in most of the file system it is most difficult to write right the problem
